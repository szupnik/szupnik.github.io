        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of this term I'd like to be able to say that I am familiar with HTML and CSS. It would also be neat if I could design my own portfolio page but I think that is a little ambitious! There is not any specific project or technology I'd like covered. The two websites that I have found that really stuck with me are two graphic designer portfolios. They're just so interactive and unique to me, but I haven't delved very deep into web design yet!</p>
