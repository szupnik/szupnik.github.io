        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of this term I'd like to be able to say that I am familiar with HTML and CSS. It would also be neat if I could design my own portfolio page but I think that is a little ambitious! There is not any specific project or technology I'd like covered. The two websites that I have found that really stuck with me are two graphic designer portfolios. They're just so interactive and unique to me, but I haven't delved very deep into web design yet!</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I'm planning to make a site about good beginner indoor plants. I'm planning on including a summary of each plant with interesting facts about them and their care in addition to a little care sheet with things like required water, sun, soil, etc. I'm planning to complement my subject matter by choosing photos that put emphasis on the plants and their leaves. I plan on using bold typography that has organic shapes to compliment the shapes of the leaves as well. I'll use a different color on each page in addition to a different image on each page to differentiate all of the plants from eachother. I might do different typefaces for each plant as well but I'm not sure if that will end up being too much differentiation between each page and end up looking messy.</p>
