        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies youâ€™d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: By the end of this term I'd like to be able to say that I am familiar with HTML and CSS. It would also be neat if I could design my own portfolio page but I think that is a little ambitious! There is not any specific project or technology I'd like covered. The two websites that I have found that really stuck with me are two graphic designer portfolios. They're just so interactive and unique to me, but I haven't delved very deep into web design yet!</p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I'm planning to make a site about good beginner indoor plants. I'm planning on including a summary of each plant with interesting facts about them and their care in addition to a little care sheet with things like required water, sun, soil, etc. I'm planning to complement my subject matter by choosing photos that put emphasis on the plants and their leaves. I plan on using bold typography that has organic shapes to compliment the shapes of the leaves as well. I'll use a different color on each page in addition to a different image on each page to differentiate all of the plants from eachother. I might do different typefaces for each plant as well but I'm not sure if that will end up being too much differentiation between each page and end up looking messy.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it</p>
        <p>Response: I definitely had myself in mind when designing this website. I recently repotted a bunch of houseplants and was referencing many websites to find the information I needed about the best soil for each of my plants. I found a lot of the websites to be really boring, so I wanted to create a website that is informative about plants but also fun to look at. So, I guess this person is a fledgling plantmom that is concerned with aesthetics- which is part of the reason she got the plants in the first place. </p>
