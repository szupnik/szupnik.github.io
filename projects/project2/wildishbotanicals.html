        <h2>ABOUT</h2> 
    <p>Wildish Botanicals is a collaborative apothecary based in Portland, OR that encourages the evolution and honoring of ancient healing traditions within modern beings through ethically and locally sourced botanicals. Wildish strives to create an accessible and safe space to provide all people with the tools and knowledge to establish, grow and maintain their herbal health awareness and practice. We believe that personal wellness serves as the backbone for healthy communities — through years of tinkering and trial and error, we are rigorous in our providing of effective and educated Wildish formulas as tinctures, capsules and teas. This all starts with the Earth, in which we empower and collaborate with farmers, foragers, and vendors who hold ecosystem health closest to their hearts. We source all of our bulk herbs within 300-miles of our shop, from land that is cared for and values a mix of productivity and sustainability. We believe that community based herbalism is radical - in which the Earth’s medicine is everybody’s medicine, and empowers us to share and grow our own pathway to healing.</p>
