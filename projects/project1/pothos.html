          <p>This plant might just be the easiest plant to care for. Though it has its preferences, pothos can tolerate most conditions. As long as you don’t completely forget about his plant, you’ll be rewarded with long trailing vines that can grow anywhere from 10 to even 30 feet long. Pothos plants will definitely give your space a tropical jungle vibe.</br></br>

            Propagating pothos is as easy as it gets! Take a few clippings from the stem of your plant and put them in a cup of water. In a few weeks those cuttings will have roots and can be put into a pot of soil. Ta da! New plant!</p>
